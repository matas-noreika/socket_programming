# Introduction
I created this repository to share with others the socket programming that I began learning in my second year of computer engineering. I am not a expert in socket programming, although I will show the basics of creating different kinds sockets that will be used for either TCP or UDP packets. The current examples will only be POSIX compliant, if I have enough energy I will add windows examples to show the differences between the platforms and API's they use.

## Prerequisites
This tutorial expects the programmer to have sufficent knowledge of the C programming language and about general network structure and protocols. The required tools are make and gcc so if they are missing on your system please ensure you have them :)
