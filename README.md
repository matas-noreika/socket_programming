# Introduction
I created this repository to share with others the socket programming that I began learning in my second year of computer engineering. I am not a expert in socket programming, although I will show the basics of creating different kinds sockets that will be used for either TCP or UDP packets. The current examples will only be POSIX compliant, if I have enough energy I will add windows examples to show the differences between the platforms and API's they use.
